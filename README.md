## My process
When i came across the design, i thought I won't be able to code it out until I gave it a try. When help me most is CSS flexbox and div container. I divided the design into three parts, the HEAD, BODY, and BOTTOM.
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- working with css flexbox
-- css hover effect

### Continued development

I will love to work on project and devlop them using react js and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
